- **File-based Logging**: Automatic log rotation with daily files
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance tracking and slow request detection
- **Security Event Logging**: Suspicious activity detection and security event tracking

### 2. Comprehensive Logging Middleware (`backend/middleware/comprehensiveLoggingMiddleware.js`)
- **Global Request Logger**: Tracks all incoming requests with full context
- **Specialized Operation Loggers**: 
  - Admin operations
  - Delivery agent operations

### 7. Enhanced Admin Dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.js`)
- **Integrated Log Viewer**: New tab for system log monitoring
- **Tab Navigation**: Seamless switching between dashboard and logs
- **Frontend Logging Integration**: All admin actions tracked
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live system status and log streaming

## üîß Integration Points

## üéâ Implementation Complete

The comprehensive logging system is now fully implemented and integrated across the entire ZAMMER platform. Admins can monitor all system operations in real-time through the integrated log viewer, and developers have access to detailed logs for debugging and performance optimization.

All operations are now tracked end-to-end with unique correlation IDs, providing complete visibility into system behavior and user interactions.
