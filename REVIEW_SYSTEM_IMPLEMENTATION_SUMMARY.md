## 🛠️ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Backend Changes**

#### **1. Enhanced Review Controller** (`backend/controllers/reviewController.js`)
```javascript
// Purchase verification before allowing review
const hasPurchased = await Order.findOne({
  user: req.user._id,
  'orderItems.product': product,
  isPaid: true,
  paymentStatus: { $in: ['completed', 'processing'] },
  status: { $nin: ['Cancelled'] }
});
```

#### **2. New API Endpoints**
- `POST /api/reviews` - Create review (with purchase verification)
- `GET /api/reviews/product/:productId` - Get product reviews (public)
- `GET /api/reviews/check/:productId` - Check review eligibility
- `GET /api/reviews/purchased-products` - Get user's purchased products
- `PUT /api/reviews/:id` - Update review
- `DELETE /api/reviews/:id` - Delete review

#### **3. Database Schema** (`backend/models/Review.js`)
```javascript
// Unique compound index prevents duplicate reviews
reviewSchema.index({ product: 1, user: 1 }, { unique: true });
```

### **Frontend Changes**

#### **1. Enhanced Product Detail Page** (`frontend/src/pages/user/ProductDetailPage.js`)
- Smart review button based on eligibility
- User-friendly messages for different states
- Real-time eligibility checking

#### **2. Review Service** (`frontend/src/services/reviewService.js`)
- Purchase verification API calls
- Error handling for unauthorized attempts
- Review eligibility checking
